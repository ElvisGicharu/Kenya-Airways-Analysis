0,30th August 2023,3,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is truly distressing for such a large company to see a total lack of respect and communication towards customers. I don't know if this is the case for other destinations outside the DRC, Kinshasa but the service is really disappointing. No luggage received and that, without any explanation or apology. Out of a total of 11 suitcases, none arrived and we then have to run after the company to get crumbs of information if the person receiving is willing and in the mood. The lack of consideration from customers is really disappointing, it's sad to see that the Pride of Africa slogan is only limited to the paint on planes and in advertising spots.  Il est vraiment désolant pour une compagnie aussi grande de constater un manque total de respect et communication envers les clients. Je ne sais pas si c'est le cas pour d'autres destinations en dehors de la RDC, Kinshasa mais le service est vraiment decevant. Aucun bagages reçu et ça, sans aucune explication ni excuses. Sur un total de 11 valises, aucune n'est arrivée et nous devons par la suite courir derrière la compagnie pour avoir des miettes d'informations si la personne qui reçoit est disposé et d'humeur. Le manque de considération des clients est vraiment decevant, c'est triste de voir que le slogan de Pride of Africa ne se limite qu'à la peinture sur les avions et dans les spots publicitaires. "
1,28th August 2023,3,United Kingdom,Business Class,✅ Trip Verified |  Dreadful airline - after emailing customer service to say both my wife and I had no entertainment system as both were broken and then no choice of food as they had run out - customer service totally uninterested and not replied. Had our money and don’t care Avoid
2,26th August 2023,2,South Africa,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  The lady at check-in was very rude and insisted on wanting to check in my colleague on a 4am flight with no alternative accommodation but a mere 200usd and we  rejected the offer as it excluded accommodation. She refused to call the manager when we requested her to and brazenly carried on until we confronted her again. Only after waiting for 55 minutes then my colleague's seat was secured and we went through the boarding gates. As if that wasn't enough, the departure time was 30min late and no apology was received from the captain. To use Kenya Airways was the biggest blunder on my side ever committed. I am a frequent flyer and have never experienced such a distasteful and shabby treatment ever. I vow never to use this airline again."
3,23rd August 2023,3,United Kingdom,Family Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dismal from start to end. Not all of the staff and crew were rude, some were just sullen and disinterested. Food was consistently awful, drinks were ok. The hard product isn’t too bad (similar to what Turkish used to operate, i.e. dated, but comfortable enough), but everything else was dreadful - checkin, lounges, boarding etc, all service points were very poor. Nairobi airport was an awful experience all 4 times (we had stopovers in both directions), expect corruption, chaos and disorganisation. I’ll do all I can to avoid Kenya Airways in future."
4,22nd August 2023,1,United States,Economy Class,"Not Verified | Airline was 1 hour late to board passengers and to 1 hour late to depart without any explanation. Food was horrible, and to make matters worse, they lost the entire passengers' luggage without any explanation. The Swiss Port employee who was left to deal with the passengers had no clue what was going on and all he could do was give us forms to fill out. All perishable items that I carried will now be trashed since the man said the earliest we could get our bags is Wednesday 8/24. A passenger on the same flight who had air tagged her luggage indicated that the bag was still at JKIA! Last month they also lost my husband's luggage and when they tracked it, it was discovered to be at the Delta baggage office still in New York instead of Kenya. 4 days later when it was delivered. They did not even bother to refund us."
5,19th August 2023,2,Uganda,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kenya Airways has really disappointed me for a second time, it's never on time, it appears 30_40 minutes late. Am supposed to be setting off to Uganda from Kenya but the plane is not even here. Same applies from Dubai we left 26 minutes late that was even before we boarded. "
6,18th August 2023,8,Vietnam,Solo Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  JNB-NBO-AMS-ZRH on 14-15 August 23. Flights on time, despite being quite full. Good announcements. Check in on transfer desk in Jo-burg, all 3 BPs issued on spot. Kenya now uses the South African Airlines lounge, which is very high class lounge with sleepers and a very diverse buffet with high quality foods. The long haul flights were both on Boeing 787-9, business class is wonderfully furnished, spacious, in 2x2x2 configuration which is perfect. Low chair fenders allow you to overlook entire cabin when seated upright. Very ample leg space in the lie-flats. Spent night in Pride lounge, Nairobi. Preordered, hot seafood meals were provided thrice on the two flights, all different variants and tasty. Take-off champagne given. Not the most sublime business class catering in the skies: food in general is not extraordinary (apart from the pre-order options), no beer choices, only the watery national Tusker Lager offered. Meals robust and reliable, pre-ordered meal managed well. FAs active and smiley, though not well coordinated, despite being many. IFE is acceptable though narrow choices on movies. Nice beds with mattresses and pillows, 2 blankets per seat. Will fly again with KQ. KLMs 52 lounge in Amsterdam is huge and good, they printed out coming Boarding Passes for me. Amsterdam-Zurich on Embraer 190 aircraft operated by KLM, well synchronised with Kenya Airways and under their flight number. Flight full. Delayed ½ hour due to complicated, tedious loading of two giant dogs, a serious unnecessary delay causing delay for 200 people. Catering was surprisingly good: menu card, nice, large food box with 3 course meal, including my favoured seafood meal. Champagne, 4 wines, and lots of hot and soft drinks offered. Swift service. Seats are just economy seats but I was given 2 seats in front row and can’t complain."
7,7th August 2023,1,South Africa,Economy Class,✅ Trip Verified | Officially the worlds worst airline. 3hr + delay from SA to Burundi and coming home they call you to board and then tell you your flight is delayed by 2hrs+. No compensation. Rude cheeky staff with no customer service. They try to push the blame to customers and have a serious attitude issue. Everything about the airline is so disappointing from the aircraft to the meals to the staff to the compensation. Been on the airport for more than 10hrs. No empathy for ppl. They tell you to book a hotel at your own expense and they can’t even accommodate ppl in lounges. Pathetic. Stay away from this airline.
8,31st July 2023,1,United Arab Emirates,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  The worst service I have ever encountered in airline, my fiancé missed her flight 4 times due to overbooking of airline. Airport workers keep on sending her back home saying that the airplane is full, I wonder how if you can treat your staff like that? How can you put up to 7 passengers waiting for more than 4 days or why would you issue staff tickets yet you know the plane is full? 30 minutes Before the gates closes the we can see that you can even issue tickets, the flight has up to 10 seats free and still you decide not to give your staff a seat? I do not ever recommend anyone to use Kenya airways"
9,27th July 2023,1,United Kingdom,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified | Do not use Kenya Airways! This was the worst decision I’ve ever made, I had two flights one from Mombasa to Nairobi which was delayed 4 hours so I almost “missed” my second flight home to London then I got there and they delayed it by an hour meaning it was 12:55pm then they told us they were delaying it till the next day at midday. The organisation was appalling. Got to a hotel room at 4am which wasn’t cleaned at all and they didn't even give me a key card for my hotel room. The flight then also got delayed another 2 hours the next day."
10,22nd July 2023,1,Oman,Economy Class,✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience with them I cant even explain my frustration. The night of my departure they told us 2 hours delay then another 3 hours then they said you know what it's cancelled. They booked me another flight the next day I reached to Dubai and the next flight was already gone by then. 
11,8th July 2023,1,South Africa,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  We travelled from Mauritius to South Africa, with a connection flight in Nairobi. In Mauritius we've checked in all 3 of our bags at the same time. Upon arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa, we were informed that my son's bag stayed behind in Mauritius. They've done a tracking on the barcode, and informed us that the bag never arrived in Nairobi either. How can you just leave the bag behind? Pathetic service!"
12,6th July 2023,1,United Arab Emirates,Business Class,"✅ Trip Verified | 
We had flown in from Dubai to Nairobi on Business class and it was good. Hence on our way back I decided to upgrade and fly business class, expecting the same. It was the biggest mistake in my life. The so called business class was just close to the premium economy of most other airlines. Seats had some push back and that's it. The leg extender was stuck and won't extend. Cabin crew said they were helpless - they didn't even try to see if it can be worked. I had to spend the entire flight sitting upright cos without the leg extender to support, I was slipping down if I reclined the seat. Horrible experience and to top it all there event wasn't a TV on the 5 hour 20 minute flight. Cabin crew said that this aircraft only has so much facility and they were looking at each other and smiling when they heard that I actually upgraded to business class. I would like to know how I can claim a refund. Where and how can I escalate this matter to. I sent a dm on Twitter to the airline which they haven't responded. Such daylight robbery must not be permitted. This isn't the upgrade we pay for. I am going to share my horrible experience on all social media channels. Interestingly I have not received any survey about my flight experience, which they promptly send. Never flying Kenya Airways again."
13,4th July 2023,3,South Africa,Couple Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst airlines I travelled on. KQ765 delayed out of JHB with no reason given only left at 02:30 on Sunday morning 25 June in stead of 01:15. Missed our connection flight out of Nairobi to Zanzibar. Ground staff made us wait for 3 hours before we got any assistance in Nairobi. Eventually got a Precision flight to Zanzibar after we had to fight the staff for seats. We were assured that the flight will have our baggage on it as it was scheduled to leave 3 hours after we got our seats. When we arrived in Zanzibar we had no baggage and the ground staff was rude saying it was not their fault we did not have our baggage and that it would be at the Zanzibar airport on Sunday evening with the next flight and if we want it we can come fetch it then. We where on honeymoon and our Hotel is 1 hour 20min away from the airport, as we booked a all inclusive package which included our transfer to and from the hotel, we had no means to get back to the airport to collect our bags. We requested that they please deliver the bags to the hotel. Ground staff said they can only deliver on Monday morning. When we asked for compensation to get some necessities like toothbrush and clean clothes, as we had no clothes or toiletries and had a dinner reservation for Sunday evening, we were told it is not their problem nor their fault our baggage did not arrive and they rushed us out of their office. Needless to say we did not receive our baggage that evening. Monday morning 26 June I phoned the lost baggage office and was told the delivery will only start work at around 10:00 and would need to make a few stops before he gets to us. We ended up getting our baggage at 15:00 Monday afternoon. Missing the whole Sunday and most of Monday of our vacation because of having no clothes."
14,3rd July 2023,1,Kenya,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  No where near does this airline come to being called the pride of Africa, it has made us as Kenyans embarrassed. The flight itself delayed for over 4 hours with no valid explanation nor any compensations. No regrets no apologies. The cabin crew are probably the rudest you'll ever come across as if they are doing you a favor. No courtesy and concerns for the three infants and 1 elderly I was traveling with on the contrary we were begging for the very basics and still not provided, like infant food! Inspire of pre-arranged meals non of my infants got the baby meals. The aircraft they are using is not for long distance international flights as the seats are extremely compact and zero legroom. We came out of the flight tired and exhausted as if we had been in war. Ground crew at both the airports equally the same and no sense of responsibility. Check in experience, 1.5 hours just to check in my family of 5 adults and 3 babies. How in the world can you explain this? Cabin smells stale from previous flight and nothing fresh. This is the worst airline I've ever travelled in."
15,1st July 2023,1,South Africa,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  Never use this airline, original flight had a 2 hour layover. It was canceled and the new flight had a 8+ hour layover. Nowhere comfortable to sit as the don't give you access to the Pride Lounge but only a food voucher with no food selection but a set meal. Staff have a terrible attitude and not bothered to help. I will never use this Kenya Airways again."
16,30th June 2023,9,United Kingdom,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  The flight on return journey was excellent. A sumptuous fish menu provided on my return yesterday. Staff are caring and lovely to talk to. I watched a cookery show and learnt a recipe on flight. Also a construction show though took it off half way due to the swearing. There wasn't much to watch for me but I left happy learning a potato recipe from South Africa. A bit of a delay in Nairobi for an hour but as I was on holiday it didn't spoil any plans. I spoke to a lady going to USA and she was given accommodation for missing connecting flight. So not so bad. My issue seems mild but one that all schools are aware of in London. We had a nut snack and I did hope that those with nut allergies where considered. At my children's 3 schools, we simply remove nuts from children packed lunch or school dinners and from view as some people get very bad allergies. Maybe it was the type of nuts served but I was surprised to see nuts on the menu."
17,25th June 2023,10,Kenya,Economy Class,"Not Verified | My family of 4 people had booked to fly from Glasgow to Nairobi thru Amsterdam on 26 th June 2023. As they were preparing to fly, they received a message that the flight from Glasgow to Amsterdam is cancelled. Thus the re-booking is done for 2 people on 26 th and the other 2 on 27 th June. That would have messed all our onward plans. As today is a Sunday, we never got any response from the agent in Scotland who booked the tickets. As a last resort, with a prejudiced mind that I am just gambling, I called Kenya Airways number. The response I received was absolutely amazing. We got re-booking from Edinburgh to Amsterdam to reach Nairobi as planned earlier. I am really thankful."
18,20th June 2023,2,Denmark,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  I had booked a return flight from Copenhagen to Mombasa and back. Unfortunately I missed my connecting flight going to Mombasa. I booked another flight to Mombasa and I immediately contacted Kenya Airways customer support to find a solution for my return flight. I wrote and called them for a week before I heard back from Kenya Airways. Fortunately the reply was (in writing) that my return ticket was confirmed. When I went to Mombasa airport to fly back they could not find my ticket. I showed them the email with the confirmation and the Kenya Airways lady in Mombasa agreed that it said my ticket was confirmed. Head office refused to let me onboard unless I purchased a new ticket. I did so to come home to my family and I was advised to contact customer service when I got back to get my money back. Then followed several months where I have been writing with Kenya Airways Customer Support. All sort of excuses came up claiming I had the wrong visa, to me being a student and other lies. Finally they concluded that in reality I had not purchased a new ticket, instead I had paid a penalty fee for missing my original flight. I then provided Kenya Airways with a copy of my receipt from Mombasa airport that clearly states that I had to my a new ticket. Since then Kenya Airways have ignored my emails. I am really shocked how Kenya Airways has tried to avoid taking responsibility and done so by lying, bullying and inventing stories to make me drop my claim. I followed every procedure the moment I missed my plane and I truly trusted and believed Kenya Airways when they wrote me that my ticket was confirmed. The lesson learned is apparently that you cannot trust Kenya Airways."
19,8th June 2023,1,United Arab Emirates,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying with Kenya Airways for the past 6 years, experienced a delay once which was okay but I had the worst experience in May where both trips were a disappointment. First, on the 14th May my Departure was delayed from 6am to 4pm. No apologies nothing, they kept on rescheduling the flight without proper communication. We late boarded Emirates to Nairobi. Again it took us hours to board from Nairobi to Mombasa. I was supposed to arrive at Mombasa 11am on the 14th Sunday but we arrived 2am on the 15th Monday.Worst scenario was on 28th May, my flight was scheduled at 8:45pm to Nairobi then connecting flight at 11.45pm.I arrived on time waited on the queue reaching the counter am told my flight was rescheduled to 7pm! On the screen I could see clearly my flight displayed at 8:45pm.Seriously ! Without even sending a notification, remember while booking phone number and email address is always part of the reservation details. The staff showed no remorse and asked me to check with reservation team. I walked politely to KQ office. I was so shocked when the reservation agent told me that my ticket is not valid ,that it's just a paper - so from changing the time to my ticket being void. This was the worst respond ever! Kenya airways staff lie a lot. He even told me that they tried to send a notification of which he wasn't sure. After insisting for a whole one hour, a supervisor later checked me in and I boarded the 8:45pm flight they booked me a hotel in Nairobi and I had to board my flight at 5pm.I missed my reporting day at work .It was my last time boarding Kenya airways Such a shame."
20,3rd June 2023,2,United Kingdom,Business,"✅ Trip Verified |  At a time when many airlines are improving their product, Kenya Airways appears to be going in the opposite direction. Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers – for the airline ‘Sky Priority’ means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was ‘reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it’. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew ‘could not find me anywhere to sit’. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways’ 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product."
21,26th May 2023,1,United Arab Emirates,Economy Class,✅ Trip Verified |  This is a bad airline. I travelled with Kenya airways on the 20th of May 2023 and now is the 26 May 2023 and l haven't received my bag. I was told the bags were left in Kenya. I have made several phone calls to Zimbabwe and also here l have visited their office in Dubai they are not giving mey bag. This is my last time to travel with Kenya airways.
22,30th April 2023,1,Ireland,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  Missed outward leg of a return flight, due to issue with KA website. Accepted loss here, though honestly feel website more than 50% responsible. Problem was return leg automatically cancelled. Engaged from two weeks before flight with what is inexplicably called 'customer support' and still had to pay again at the last minute to get a flight back to Nairobi. Total loss considerably more than the original return flight total. Sent at least 8 messages to customer support. Initial replies reassuring and seemed to offer resolution, but nothing happened. Reassurances turned out to be misleading and the information I needed was never offered. Customer service agents, while courteous and polite, seem to assume that customers will have an understanding of the rules and practices of the dystopian KA universe. No useful information is provided. It also appears that agents do not have the authority to actually resolve anything. Therefore, they do not really engage with an issue, but dole out meaningless bland reassurances. To get a flight, it required a very long and expensive phone call with an agent who had to constantly refer to a supervisor. Thankfully there are alternatives to KA, both externally and internally."
23,1st April 2023,8,South Africa,Solo Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very good flight, excellent crew on board, as was the food and drink. My only gripe is the business class seats could do with an update, but they are comfortable none the less."
24,29th March 2023,8,Vietnam,Solo Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kigali - Nairobi - Entebbe return 26-27 March 2023. Aircraft were narrowbodies. The first flight was on a B737, while the three remaining flights were on E190’s. All four (short-haul) flights were on time. This was a Mileage Run to retain my Flying Blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month. I was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in Kigali. They said, upon liaising with Immigration I Airport, that my reason to travel was not valid. I tried to change purpose, but the damage was done, which forced me to postpone the entire trip. However, later I had the ticket reissued by KQ town office in Kigali, who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a No Show case. They even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs. I even got a much better (and more expensive) itinerary avoiding night-flights though extending my transit lounge stays. While the junior KQ staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding, the KQ staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the OTA. The rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects. Lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights, and the lounges are all of good and solid quality. Slept fine in Pride Lounge in Nairobi where I spent an eve and a night. Effective boardings/deboardings by either bus, on foot, or by jetbridge. Onboard, welcome champagne available on all four flights. I had prebooked seat 1A which was given me throughout. I preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty. The sole exception was a morning flight, where they could not manage my seafood, despite it appeared in their flight manuscript; not a big issue, but they apologised. KQ always manage special meals effectively; this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like Qatar Airways or KLM allows for. The crews on all flights were fine, professional, caring, and in good mood. The food is getting better on these regional flights, and I had my tasty hot mini-meals served throughout. Hot towels provided. Nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks, which were served several times. The challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turn-around in EBB to which airport staff were confused as I instantly returned to my origin without going landside. They allowed me not to buy a transit visa, and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me – I was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours. Onboard, no IFE and no WiFi which is fine for short flights. No luggage/baggage issues. Flying Blue status respected and some SkyPriority entitlements were given. E.g. priority boarding. Recommended. Will fly them again. Would have given 10/10 but have to deduct a bit for denied boarding initially by the junior, incompetent staff member in Kigali airport."
25,28th March 2023,1,United States,Family Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure. The positive feelings I had about Kenya Airways prior to leaving Africa have been replaced by a lack of trust, a vow to never fly KA again, and to pursue informing all travelers I can to be aware and leery of KA’s management of refunds and its ultimate care and respect for passengers."
26,26th March 2023,1,United Arab Emirates,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified | On the Nairobi to Addis Ababa leg of my inbound flight from Dubai to Addis Ababa on March 16, 2023, our flight KQ402 was supposed to depart at 17.00 but finally after a very long and painful waiting we boarded the plane at 23.00pm! Imagine arriving from Dubai at 7.00am and waiting all day long and all night and add to this no cooperative staff and zero services! To add insult to injury, again they did it on the return flight! Apparently, delayed flights are a norm in this airline. Our flight KQ310 on 26 march was delayed by almost 2 hours. Similar things happened to me on my previous flights on this Airline, I wouldn’t even rate them with a single star, but there is no option with zero star!"
27,24th March 2023,1,United Kingdom,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  Schedule for 18.40 , delayed still waiting at the boarding gates time now 22.03. I asked them to arrange taxi from Mombasa Airport to Mombasa town. They refused. Worst airline. Even flew from Heathrow on 20th upgraded the seat with €100.00. When boarding the plane they given the seats two passengers at the same. I had to seat in ordering seats. Stay away from Kenya Airways"
28,17th March 2023,1,South Africa,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had 3 hours delay at the airport in Kenya and what was funny was to be told they cannot trace where the plane was but it was already in the country. Asking them that they need to send a message for my connection flight that there will a delay, they advised that they will send and email. Upon arriving at OR I was told there is nothing they can do and there was no email sent and they just need to book accommodation and in the morning I will have to come back to the office to meet their manager. They could not assist and had to buy a new flight for the missed connection flight as they did not take responsibility knowing that I missed the connection flight because of their delays. At the booked hotel, were told that was a daily occurrence with Kenya Airways, they have 10 or more people booked because to those delays. They have less planes and need to use same plane when it lands."
29,15th March 2023,3,United Kingdom,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am very disappointed about Kenya Airways. No tea or coffee on any of 4 flights I had with them. Ended up with most humiliating customer service representative in Nairobi Airport. She threatened not to let me on flight if I did not show her my EU settlement status. And this is at the boarding gate after passport control! My partner showed his passport and boarding pass to another representative and was let through with no questions. Some French people were told to go away and come back in 40 minutes, as I was still standing there trying to get Internet working and figuring out how to get my prove of EU settlement status, which I don't need to fly to London anyway if I am EU citizen. Avoid this airline whenever possible."
30,15th March 2023,1,Zimbabwe,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  From Harare it was delayed by two hours meaning we were suppose to miss our connecting flight in Nairobi but was assured to get another flight. Upon arrival discovered the flight was cancelled. We were put in hotels for the airport were we only slept for 1:30 mins. There was chaos to get our passport back when we returned to the airport, was rebooked for Paris now with a 6 hour layover in Paris (previous had 2 hours for connecting flight). When about to board the flight was delayed again by 1 hour."
31,14th March 2023,1,South Africa,Economy Class,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Kenya Airways to travel to Dubai for a conference on the 4th of December 2022. My luggage was delayed and as such was not available when I landed in Dubai on the 5th December. As such I needed to incur expenses to purchase clothing and undergarments in order to be able to attend the conference. My luggage was returned to me on the 6th of December. I submitted a claim for my expenses to customer care at Kenya Airways on 12 December. I have yet to receive any assistance from the airline to date despite following up multiple times. The only feedback that I have received is receipt of my email and advice that they have escalated my claim. I will NEVER travel Kenya Airways again and would not advise anyone to travel via this airline either.
32,5th March 2023,1,Nigeria,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the most horrible flight experience with Kenya Airways and no compensation for delays and lost luggage. My flight from JHB - Lagos on Thursday 1/03/2023 was delayed for nearly 3 hours in Johannesburg. I missed my flight from Nairobi to Lagos. Because I had a flight to catch to Berlin I jumped into Accra flight and from from there paid for Lagos flight. In spite of the delay and trouble going through Ghana, and extra cost I wasn’t prepared for. On getting to Lagos, my baggage/luggage is missing. I needed my baggage to travel to Berlin. "
33,25th February 2023,1,United Kingdom,Economy Class,"Not Verified |  Paid for a flight at the airport to fly out shortly after, only to be immediately put on standby because they overbooked the flight. When asking for full refund, they hold $5000 for 45 days (and still not received) and only offer of refund was with a no show fee deducted, despite being at the airport when making the booking! Frankly unacceptable behaviour and no urgency to refund in full. Strongly advise to never book with this airline!"
34,25th February 2023,1,United Kingdom,Business Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding and seating was fine. First flight was in what I would call premium economy, whereas the second flight was in, albeit tired, in business class. The food was not very much what I would call “pride of Africa” standard but the attendants were very helpful. I was very concerned when we were sprayed with a very noxious smelling substance - 8 canisters held by two attendants. Without any prior warning or consultation. The contents of these canisters was not revealed to me even though i asked. I am on day 7 of feeling very ill with breathing trouble and eyesight and diarrhoea. I attribute this to the 3 episodes of being sprayed - once on the first flight, then again while stationery at Victoria falls by crew with big spray containers and hand sprays as you would do in a field (or should not do). Then again after departure from Nairobi. The food was mediocre to poor. I’d hate to think what the economy class food was like if this was business class. My seat in the first plane could not recline and the seat in the second one struggled to go up or down. Well I certainly would like to know what we were sprayed with and how we were not informed thereof."

On time departure, excellent in flight service on both sectors. Full meal and bar service including an excellent French champagne. In all, a great trip and an excellent start to my visit to Zanzibar."
36,18th February 2023,8,United States,Solo Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  On Jan 27th, i flew from JFK via Kenya airways with a layover in Nairobi, continued with a flight from Nairobi to Johannesburg, final destination Capetown. In the interim I was not able to to retrieve my luggage in Johannesburg, apparently lost in transit. Spoke to a representative from Kenya Airways, Jum,  who took all of my information & my number. He kept me informed regarding the status of my luggage & before I boarded my flight to Johannesburg. He was able to locate my luggage & as promised it was there at my final destination. I just wanted to thank him again for his service & diligence in helping to resolve my dilemma. They need more people like him in public service."
37,13th February 2023,8,India,Economy Class,"✅ Trip Verified |  After booking my ticket I was very much afraid of all the negative reviews I have read. But fortunately I had a pleasant flight. Both flights departure was on time. Luggage was received in good condition. Only thing that can be improved, may be the food. Some extra items can be added."
38,12th February 2023,1,United Kingdom,Economy Class,✅ Trip Verified |  They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person’s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn’t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone’s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a “picture” of a wrapped bag (I didn’t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time. Kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and I have no winter cloth to wear here but they aren’t even ready to help
39,21st January 2023,1,United Kingdom,Couple Leisure,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible first time experience. Travelled from London on 19th January to Nairobi transiting to Ghana. Before that they changed our departure time from Nairobi to 30mins late. As if that was not enough, we got to Nairobi at about 9pm after being delayed at Heathrow only to be told our flight had been delayed again for another 6hours. Instead of leaving at 10pm, we were to leave at 4am. No communication, and not even a rep to speak to another airport in Nairobi, which is their headquarters. No body cared about us and all a lady could say it, we will give you hot food. Such a horrible experience, to just sit at the airport for 6hours, after an 8and half hour flight with no place to freshen up, and then instead of leaving at 4, we left at 4.50am. No apologies from anyone. Now I am dreading my return journey. I will not take this airline again and will certainly not recommend to any one. Shame to treat other Africans as 2nd class citizens and yet call yourself the pride of Africa. Maybe it’s time to change that name not befitting your poor services."
